Using the given  dataset to predict the diabetes 💙 suffering from : Diabetes or not 🧑


![Generic badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Limitations-:-red.svg) 

●	Use any machine learning algorithm to create your own prediction model.

●	The model should give us : Is that person suffering from Diabetes or NOT 🚑.

●	Split the dataset into training and test sets and provide the accuracy of the test set.

I'm using Machine Learning  techniques to predict the diabetes in human.
I have been trying to solved this problem using  **Machine Learning** algorthms known as **Support Vector Machine(SVM)** but you can use any  algorithms 🇩🇿 for better accuracy.

***1----> Stand for Suffering from: Diabetes.***

***0----> Stand for NOT Suffering from Diabetes.***
